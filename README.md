# Virtual-Mouse

The virtual mouse model works by recognizing the motion of the hand. The virtual mouse can be used inplace of the physical mosue.
The Virtual Mouse is a way of controlling the position of the cursor with the hand without using any other devices. To make this 
possible we only required a webcam as an input device. The clicking and moving of the cursor can be done by different hand gestures. 
The algorithm used in this system makes use of the machine learning algorithm and deep learning for detecting hand gestures. The 
softwareâ€™s required for this system is Python and OpenCV.The output can be simultaneously viewed on the screen so that the further 
actions can be calibrated by the user. Hence, this system will avoid COVID-19 spread by eliminating human intervention and reduces 
the use of devices, and increases the human-computer interaction.

---REQUIRMENTS---

This model works only on the system which has a camera. The system must have a minimum requirments of 6GB RAM and a 2GB GPU.
